# Lawrence Berkeley National Lab Numerai Dimensionality Reduction Framework

A data-driven dimensionality reduction analysis utilizing Dask and Scikit-Learn to be used in a paper for Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. In here are two notebooks that are works-in-progress that utilize an innovative framework of domain-agnostic dimensionality reduction and feature selection on heavily obfuscated datasets to boost model performance. Positive results in this work could have implications in making public data science competitions feasible with sensitive data with privacy concerns. The data comes from two sources: Numer.ai, which is a public finance modeling data science competition, and HVAC/Weather dataset collected by Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory's weather gauges, which collect several weather indicators such as air temperature, humidity, and dew point. While Numer.ai's dataset is heavily obfuscated with an extremely low signal to noise ratio, the HVAC/Weather dataset is meant to showcase the framework on data which we would consider to be easier to model as we have domain knowledge on the relationships between features (weather) and the target variable (air conditioning/heating usage).

Much of the code only functions in a HPC as the runtimes and core usage are somewhat unrealistic for local machines. However, users who wish to try out this framework may make use of cloud computing environments such as Google Cloud Platform and connect the Dask client to remote clusters in this manner.
